# object_oriented_programming

We design a library system using OOP, creating a series of classes (such as library, case, floor, etc) and implementing necessary methods (such as checking in/checking out books). One important step is to make sure our library class implements an iterable interface so that we can retrieve a complete list of books including those that are checked out.
